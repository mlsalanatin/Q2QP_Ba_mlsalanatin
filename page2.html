            <img src="media/images/date.jpg" alt="" title="We helped organize dates for couples. Many couples don't have the privilege to go on dates due to personal constraints, mostly due to time and money. With our help, we made sure that they have the time to enjoy a date with their partner with no worries about paying for anything!">
            <img src="media/images/retreat.jpg" alt="" title="Many couples are slowly drifting apart due to many reasons. A retreat at a tropical beach with nobody else to disturb their peace sure helps in rekindling the lost spark in the relationship. Alone time in a relaxing place promotes communication, trust, intimacy, and a deeper connection between partners.">
            <img src="media/images/museum.jpg" alt="" title="Don't know what your partner is like? We helped many couples get to know more about each other by bringing them in an art exhibit. How they react to being in a museum, how they assess each art piece, and what they say about everything in general will give you an idea of who your partner is.">
            <img src="media/images/music.jpg" alt="" title="Music connects people. Music is another method we used to bring couples together. Most couples don't have the same music taste, letting them listen to the other partner's music gives them an idea of what their partner is like. Many of the couples that tried this method reported to have a better love life.">
            <img src="media/images/letter.jpg" alt="" title="When you write a love letter, you never know what you're going to say, and when you're done writing, you don't know what you've said. We encourage people to write love letters as it is spontaneous and true to heart.">

        <h1>Involvements</h1>
        <p>At <i>only, in my dreams</i>, our involvements extend beyond the realm of workshops and events. Actively engaging with the community, we participate in outreach programs, collaborate with educational institutions to instill values of empathy, support <a href="https://kevinkintanar.github.io/Q2QP_CA_KINTANAR"><strong>mental health initiatives</strong></a>, and run love-themed art exhibitions. Additionally, our partnerships with local businesses and collaborative events with like-minded advocacy groups amplify our impact, creating a holistic approach to positive societal change. Through love letter campaigns with a philanthropic twist and social media initiatives, we aspire to spread warmth, kindness, and the transformative power of love across diverse spaces. These involvements reflect our commitment to making love a catalyst for positive change on both individual and community levels.</p>
